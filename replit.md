- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom bakery theme
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and bcrypt
- **Session Management**: Express session with PostgreSQL store
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with role-based access control

### Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations with version control
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL or standard PostgreSQL
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for Express sessions
